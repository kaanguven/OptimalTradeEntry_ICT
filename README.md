What Are Fibonacci Retracement Levels?
Fibonacci retracement levels—stemming from the Fibonacci sequence—are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur.

Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.

The indicator is useful because it can be drawn between any two significant price points, such as a high and a low. The indicator will then create the levels between those two points.

Suppose the price of a stock rises $10 and then drops $2.36. In that case, it has retraced 23.6%, which is a Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are found throughout nature. Therefore, many traders believe that these numbers also have relevance in financial markets.

Fibonacci retracement levels were named after Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, who was famously known as Leonardo Fibonacci.  However, Fibonacci did not create the Fibonacci sequence. Instead, Fibonacci introduced these numbers to western Europe after learning about them from Indian merchants.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
Fibonacci retracement levels connect any two points that the trader views as relevant, typically a high point and a low point.
The percentage levels provided are areas where the price could stall or reverse.
The most commonly used ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.
These levels should not be relied on exclusively, so it is dangerous to assume that the price will reverse after hitting a specific Fibonacci level.
Fibonacci numbers and sequencing were first used by Indian mathematicians centuries before Leonardo Fibonacci.

With this python code, you can use the GOLD levels, that is, the return levels for "bull" or "bear", in the fastest way for any exchange.

You can even build yourself a simple trading bot by executing automated orders asynchronously between these two Fibonacci Prices.
